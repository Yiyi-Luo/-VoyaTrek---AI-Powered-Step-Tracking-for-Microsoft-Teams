# VoyaTrek: AI-Powered Step Tracking for Microsoft Teams
#### Authors: Dan Hales & Yiyi Luo
**VoyaTrek** is a Microsoft Teams plugin developed to support the company's summer walkathon initiative. The application allows employees to easily log their daily step counts directly within Microsoft Teams, view their personal statistics, and participate in friendly competition through a leaderboard system.

***This project*** was developed as a response to the "Request for Proposals on Generative AI Pilots" initiative. VoyaTrek demonstrates the capabilities of generative AI in creating real-world applications with minimal human intervention:

- The project began with a single human prompt describing the desired functionality, all subsequent development was guided by Claude's instructions; 100% of the code and implementation scripts were generated by Claude AI
- Humans provided feedback by sharing error messages and testing results, Claude AI generated solutions to all technical challenges encountered
- The documentation, workflow diagrams, and feature summaries were also created with Claude's assistance

**The Original Prompt That Started It All**:

> *We want to use gen AI to create a full-stack plugin for Microsoft Teams that allows everyone to log their daily step count via messages in the chat window. We propose the following syntax: '@voyatrek 10000 steps yesterday'. The plugin should detect this message, parse '10000', create a valid date for 'yesterday', and make an entry (username, 10000, '2025-02-28') in a Postgres instance on Azure. We should use AI to generate both a secure application meeting this spec and full configuration/setup instructions, then get the plugin approved for use by the whole company to submit steps for the summer walkathon.*

From this single prompt, Claude AI guided the entire development process, from environment setup to database configuration to user interface design, culminating in the fully functional application documented in this presentation.tion.

## I. Project Overview

**VoyaTrek** is a Microsoft Teams plugin developed to support the company's summer walkathon initiative. The application allows employees to easily log their daily step counts directly within Microsoft Teams, view their personal statistics, and participate in friendly competition through a leaderboard system.

- ### 1. Purpose
  - Enable employees to track their step counts for the company walkathon
  - Provide a simple, intuitive interface integrated with Microsoft Teams
  - Foster friendly competition and encourage physical activity

- ### 2. Core Features
  - Natural language step logging through Teams chat
  - Personal statistics tracking with streak monitoring
  - Company-wide leaderboard
  - Interactive, color-coded user interface

- ### 3. Technology Stack
  - **Frontend**: Microsoft Teams Adaptive Cards
  - **Backend**: Node.js with Bot Framework SDK
  - **Database**: PostgreSQL on Azure
  - **Hosting**: Azure App Service

- ### 4. Functionality

VoyaTrek allows users to input step counts using natural language within Microsoft Teams. The primary command format is:

```
@voyatrek [number] steps [date]
```

Example commands:
- `@voyatrek 10000 steps yesterday`
- `@voyatrek 8000 steps today`
- `@voyatrek 12500 steps 2025-02-15`

The plugin processes these messages by:
1. Parsing the step count (e.g., "10000")
2. Interpreting the date (e.g., calculating "yesterday" as the previous day)
3. Recording the entry in the Azure PostgreSQL database with the username, step count, and date

Additional commands provide access to statistics and leaderboards:
- `@voyatrek stats` - View personal step statistics
- `@voyatrek leaderboard` - View company-wide rankings
- `@voyatrek log` - Access the step logging interface

The application features an intuitive, color-coded interface with distinct visual themes for each function:
- Main menu (blue) - Central navigation hub
- Statistics (green) - Personal progress tracking
- Leaderboard (gold) - Company-wide competition
- Step logging (orange) - Data entry

- ### 5. Implementation Approach

The development leveraged AI assistance to:
1. Design the application architecture
2. Generate the core application code
3. Implement database connectivity and data processing
4. Create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface
5. Develop deployment and configuration instructions

The resulting application is secure, user-friendly, and ready for company-wide deployment to support the summer walkathon initiative.
